RedVis; Reddit Visualized
======
A between-subreddit activity visualization tool.

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between subreddits on the online forum www.reddit.com.
We will focus on subreddit relationships defined by user interactions.
A user that is active in two subreddits will define a relationship between these subreddits.

This visualization is intended to show characteristics of the userbase, by showing related interests (based on the subreddits), and perhaps size of user communities in a later stage.

## Tools
We intend to use the [vis.js Graph visualization tool](http://visjs.org/docs/graph.html).
This library provides an easy way of setting up a Node graph to display the relations we want to visualize.

## Deliverable
The deliverable for this project will be the graphing tool.
It should be interactive; the user should be able to zoom in on interactions, selecting and focussing on subreddits and their direct relations.
